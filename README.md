# Introduction
LedBox V3 is an ultimate, sound-reactive LED controller, compatible with 5-12V addressable LED strips (WS281x, SK6812, etc.), supporting 3-(data) and 4-(data/clock) wire signal protocols. Whether you prefer a plug-and-play solution, or you are a maker that loves tinkering with hardware, it offers the best of both worlds.
